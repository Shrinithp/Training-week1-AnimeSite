    <h1>This is a Advertisment Page</h1>
    <a href="index.html">Home page</a>

    <p>I have created this page because most of the time if we go and search any movies in any free websites they conatin a lot of add pages</p>
    <p>for example refer to this link <a href="https://zoro.to/">Zoro.to</a> this is the website which I refer to watch anime. when I open this website and search any anime it will redirect me to some Advertisment page</p>
    <p>In order to do the same Advertisment page in my website I have used onclick event handler.</p>
    <h2>click on the same Go button again to see the real page</h2>
